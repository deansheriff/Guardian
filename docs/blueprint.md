# **App Name**: Guardian Angel

## Core Features:

- Secure User Authentication: User authentication and authorization for guards and admins using secure password management. Guards will be restricted to their allowed zones. 
- Geofenced Clock-In: Geofence-based clock-in, restricting guards from clocking in outside a defined location.
- Automated Check-In Prompts: Location and time-based prompts for guards to check in, confirming their presence.
- Admin Activity Dashboard: Admin dashboard for activity monitoring. Log entries will show guards clock-in time and check-in timestamps. This feature should be augmented by a tool that can review text descriptions of unusual activities.
- Generate Reports: Generate summary reports that indicate all shift check-ins per day.
- Prompt Adjustment: Enable user preferences to adjust the prompts' frequency.
