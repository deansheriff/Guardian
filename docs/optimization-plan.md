## üé® Design & Aesthetic Optimizations

### 1. Unified Theming and Branding
- **Consistent Color Palette:** Establish a strict color palette for primary, secondary, accent, success, and error states to be used across the entire application.
- **Typography Scale:** Define a clear typographic hierarchy for headings, subheadings, and body text to improve readability and visual consistency.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Implement a theme toggle to allow users to switch between light and dark modes based on their preference and environment.

### 2. Enhanced User Feedback & Interaction
- **Interactive Elements:** Add subtle animations and transitions to buttons, modals, and other interactive elements to make the UI feel more responsive and alive.
- **Skeleton Loaders:** Replace empty loading states with skeleton screens that mimic the layout of the content being loaded. This provides a better perceived performance.
- **Descriptive Notifications:** Enhance the `useToast` hook to provide more context in notifications, using different colors and icons for success, warning, and error messages.

### 3. Dashboard Redesigns
- **Admin Dashboard:**
    - **Data Visualization:** Convert raw data from tables into charts and graphs. For example, a pie chart showing guard distribution by location or a bar chart for activity logs over time.
    - **At-a-Glance Stats:** Add a summary section with key metrics like "Active Guards," "Locations Monitored," and "Incidents Today."
- **Guard Dashboard:**
    - **Mission Control UI:** Redesign the dashboard to be a central hub for guards, featuring a mini-map of their assigned location, a prominent shift timer, and quick-action buttons for check-ins and incident reporting.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Functional Optimizations

### 1. Real-time Capabilities
- **Live Guard Tracking:** Implement WebSockets to provide admins with a real-time map view of all on-duty guards' locations.
- **Live Activity Feed:** The admin's activity log should update in real-time as events occur, without needing a page refresh.

### 2. Advanced Guard Management
- **Shift Scheduling System:** Develop a dedicated scheduling module where admins can create, assign, and manage guard shifts on a weekly or monthly calendar.
- **Performance Analytics:** Track metrics like on-time check-in rates, patrol completion times, and number of incidents reported to create guard performance profiles.
- **Gamify Ranks:** Make the "Rookie" to "Elite" rank system more impactful. Higher ranks could unlock benefits like shift preferences or small bonuses, encouraging better performance.

### 3. Incident Reporting & Management
- **In-App Reporting:** Allow guards to create detailed incident reports directly from the app, including severity level, a written description, and photo/video uploads.
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Automatically trigger high-priority alerts (push notifications, email, or SMS) to admins when a severe incident is reported.

### 4. Geofencing Automation
- **Automated Check-in/out:** Use the existing `radius` property on locations to implement geofencing. Automatically log a guard's arrival and departure when their device enters or leaves the designated area.

### 5. Enhanced Reporting
- **PDF Report Generation:** Allow admins to generate and download comprehensive PDF reports for payroll, incident analysis, or client briefings, with filters for date ranges, locations, and guards.
- **AI-Powered Summaries:** Leverage the existing AI flow (`summarize-security-events.ts`) to create automated daily or weekly summary reports of all notable events.
